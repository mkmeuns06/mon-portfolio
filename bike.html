            <h1>ONELINE BIKE SALES SITE</h1>
            <p>We designed several pages for this online bike-buying site: a home page with a carousel highlighting the different models, a page dedicated to the sale of each bike, as well as a shopping cart page and a contact page. This project was particularly motivating, as it enabled us to concretely measure the skills acquired over the year by comparing it to our previous projects.</p>
