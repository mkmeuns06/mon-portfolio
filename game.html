            <h1>SURVIVAL GAME</h1>
            <p>We created a game featuring a hero: 007. We were inspired by the latest film: No Time to Die. We organized several missions and the result of each choice made by the player was calculated as a percentage and added up at the end to announce the final result and whether the mission was successful or not.</p>
